# Usefull scripts
This is a small repository of my scripts, they may or may not actually be usefull. 

# Notes:

The root folder of the local repo must be named the same as the repo, so "usefull-scripts" in this case

The root folder must be in your home directory, so /home/Insert name of your user/

# Updates

I will remove the ".sh" ending to all scrips on 2019-05-9, this is to make adding the scrips to $PATH easier so you don't have to type out the .sh ending

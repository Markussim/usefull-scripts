# Usefull scripts
This is a small repository of my scripts, they may or may not actually be usefull. 

# Notes:

The root folder of the local repo must be named the same as the repo, so "usefull-scripts" in this case

The root folder must be in your home directory, so /home/Insert name of your user/

# Unstable

The unstable branch is for testing new features, it includes the lastest versions of all of the scripts but might not work or change quite often. It is not recomended
